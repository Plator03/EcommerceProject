# EcommerceProject

# i used Spring boot to do the backend work 
# for my frontend i used angular and i had 2gb folder in my frontend/angular-ecommerce thats the reason you cant see the code so im going to give a link to my one drive folder for you to access the full project
# to run the project just run the backend code on intellij by default and then for frontend just use vscode and go to angular-ecommerce folder and type npm start in terminal.
